# MountainsHelper

This project uses .NET Framework, WinForms, SQL database and Dapper to communicate with the database.

MountainsHelper is my own project. As I started to do hiking more and more I got frustrated with sites that allow you to search for tours to the mountains, but are missing some features I wanted. The problem is I couldn't find a site where I could search for a tour based on 
attributes. Thats the main feature of this project to have a database of tours that are sorted based on country and difficulty. Database have to be filled by the user. Statistics form is meant to be a tracker of your own achievements.

The project is finished, but I still work on some bug fixes.

This application will not work properly on any PC due to SQL database working only on local PCs!
